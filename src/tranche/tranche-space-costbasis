# Strat: Recharging tranches
#
# High level idea is that the strategy offers a firm price for batches of tokens.
# Each batch is called a "tranche".
#
# Every time a batch of tokens fully clears a new price further from the previous
# trades is offered for the next tranche.
#
# For example, if 1000 USDC was available in a tranche to buy WLTH at
# 1 USDC per WLTH and this fully cleared, the next tranche might be to buy up to
# 1000 USDC at 0.9 USDC per WLTH, then 0.8, etc. etc.
#
# Tranches slowly recharge over time passively when no trades are happening against
# the current price offer. For example, the strategy might recharge 1 tranche per
# day, so if the last trade left 500 USDC remaining in a 1000 USDC tranche at
# 0.9 USDC per WLTH then after 24 hours the strategy will be offering 500 USDC
# at 1 USDC per WLTH. I.e. 0.5 tranches were recharged at 0.9 ratio and then
# another 0.5 tranches were recharged at 1 ratio. After another 12 hours
# there will be 1000 USDC on offer at 1 ratio, etc.
#
# Almost everything about the strat is bindable and chartable, e.g.
# - The algorithms that determine the price and amount of each tranche
# - The recharge rate and delay before the passive recharge starts to kick in
# - Whether the amounts per tranche are denominated in the input or output token
# - Whether the strategy is buying or selling TKN
# - An optional conversion between the input/output token and some external
#   price, e.g. converting WETH in a vault to USD equivalent.

#tranche-space-per-second !The amount of tranche space that is recharged per second.
#tranche-space-recharge-delay !The duration in seconds that no recharging occurs after a trade occurs.

#tranche-size-base !Base tranche size is the size of the smallest tranche, denominated in output token. 
#tranche-size-growth !The exponential growth factor of the size of each tranche. E.g. 0.01 is 1% output amount growth per tranche.

#io-ratio-expr !The binding to get the IO ratio for the current tranche space.
/* #io-ratio-base !The base IO ratio, as a decimal 18 fixed point number. This is the IO ratio at tranche space 0 and grows according to the growth factor per tranche. */
#io-ratio-spread !The size of the spread in percentage terms which is the distance of the first tranche away from the midpoint.
#io-ratio-growth !The exponential growth factor of the IO ratio. E.g. 0.01 is 1% io-ratio growth per tranche.

#reference-reserve !The token that will be used to compare against the reference stable token to calculate the TWAP for dollar equivalent conversions.
#reference-reserve-decimals !The number of decimals of the reserve token.
#twap-duration !The duration in seconds of the TWAP window for dollar equivalence conversions.
#twap-fee !The uniswap fee tier to use for the TWAP.

#min-tranche-space-diff !The minimum tranche space difference that is allowed per trade. Prevents dusting the strat to stop it recharging.
#tranche-space-snap-threshold !The threshold in tranche space to snap to the nearest tranche to avoid dust issues at the edges.

#initial-tranche-space !The initial tranche space when the order is first deployed.
#get-last-tranche !The binding to get the last tranche space and update time.
#set-last-tranche !The binding to set the last tranche space and update time.

#test-now !Returned by get-test-last-tranche to allow the current time to be bound for testing.

#io-ratio-multiplier !The binding to get the IO ratio multiplier.

#amount-is-output !Whether the amount is an output or input amount. Non-zero means output (i.e. normal orderbook behaviour), zero means input.
